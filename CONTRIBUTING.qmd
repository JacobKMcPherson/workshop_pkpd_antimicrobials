2. Sets up Quarto environment
3. Renders the presentation
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## PDF Releases

PDF versions of the presentation are automatically generated and attached to GitHub releases:

1. **Automatic Release**: Create a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`) to trigger PDF generation and release creation
2. **Manual Release**: Use the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab for the "Build PDF and Create Release" workflow
3. **Generated PDF**: The PDF is named `workshop_pkpd_antimicrobials.pdf` and attached to the release

To create a new release with PDF:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
