This **interactive** workshop provides trainees the opportunities to learn the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), with a particular emphasis on antimicrobial agents. Participants will gain hands-on experience with the analysis of pharmacokinetic data using the open-source, free-forever *r* programming language. By highlighting the role of PK/PD as a bridge between laboratory research and clinical drug development, the workshop will illustrate how these principles guide decision-making across the drug development pipelineâ€”from candidate selection to regulatory approval.
